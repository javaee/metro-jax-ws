<p>This document explains the samples that are bundled along with JAX-WS RI 2.1.2 M1. The samples included with JAX-WS RIthat is distributed on Java.net documents how to use JAX-WS RIin a non-Java EE 5 servlet container using a proprietary deployment descriptor
    <code>sun-jaxws.xml</code> and servlet
    <code>com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet</code>. This means that you can these JAX-WS RIapplications in any servlet container that has been enabled with JAX-WS RI. Applications that use the proprietary DD and servlet will run in a JAX-WS RIenabled Java EE 5 servlet container, but they will be non-portable. If you wish to use these JAX-WS RIsamples in a Java EE container in a Java EE portable manner you need to modify them to use the standard Java EE 5 deployment descriptor; please refer to the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/index.jsp">Java EE 5</a> or
    <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">Glassfish</a> documentation/samples.
    <p>All these samples are tested to run on
      <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/v2-b50.html">Glassfish Promoted Build v2 50</a> build and on Apache Tomcat 5.x.

    <p>
      <br> It is essential for the service endpoint to be deployed on Application Server before clients can be built because clients use the WSDL exposed from the service endpoint deployed in the Application Server. So please make sure that your Application Server is either running before the
      <code>server</code> target is invoked or run it after the
      <code>server</code> target is invoked. You will have to wait a few minutes for the Application Server to deploy the service endpoint correctly before building the client.
