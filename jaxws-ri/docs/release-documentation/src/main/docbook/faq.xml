    <title>FAQ</title>

    <section xml:id="section-jaxws-faq1">
        <title>Does JAX-WS 2.0 support JAX-RPC 1.X?</title>
        <para>No. Although, JAX-WS's roots come from JAX-RPC, JAX-WS is a 
                completely different component than JAX-RPC.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="section-jaxws-faq2">
        <title>What is the difference between JAX-RPC and JAX-WS ?</title>
        <para>One of the main difference between JAX-RPC and JAX-WS is the 
            programming model. A JAX-WS based service uses annotations (such @WebService) 
            to declare webservice endpoints. Use of these annotations obviates the need 
            for deployment descriptors. With JAX-WS, you can have a webservice deployed 
            on a Java EE compliant application server without a single deployment descriptor. 
            Apart from these, other additional features (such asynchronous callbacks etc) 
            are also present.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="section-jaxws-faq3">
        <title> Can a JAX-WS and a JAX-RPC based service co-exist?</title>
        <para>Yes.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="section-jaxws-faq4">
        <title> Is it downloadable from maven repository ?</title>
        <para>Yes from <link xlink:href="https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/com/sun/xml/ws"/>.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="section-jaxws-faq5">
        <title>How do I find out which version of the JAX-WS RI I'm using?</title>
        <para>Run the following command
<programlisting language="cli">$ wsgen or wsimport -version</programlisting>
Alternatively, each JAX-WS jar has version information in its META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.
        </para>        
    </section>
    
    <section xml:id="section-jaxws-faq6">
        <title>How can I change the Web Service address dynamically for a request ?</title>
        <para>
            <programlisting language="java">
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, "..."); 
            </programlisting>
        </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="section-jaxws-faq8">
        <title>How do I do basic authentication in JAX-WS ?</title>
        <para>
            You can do the following:
            <programlisting language="java">
HelloService service = new HelloService();
Hello proxy = (service.getHelloPort());
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.USERNAME_PROPERTY, "userfoo");
((BindingProvider)proxy).getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.PASSWORD_PROPERTY, "passbar"); 
            </programlisting>
            USERNAME_PROPERTY, PASSWORD_PROPERTY are used primarily for service requests. 
            I think when you instantiate Service, it fetches WSDL and the server is returning 401. 
            You could try any one of the following solutions.
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>Use java.net.Authenticator class in your client application.</listitem>
                <listitem>Provide a local access to the WSDL using catalog. There is a catalog sample in the jax-ws distribution.</listitem>
                <listitem>Configure web.xml to allow GET requests without authentication</listitem>
