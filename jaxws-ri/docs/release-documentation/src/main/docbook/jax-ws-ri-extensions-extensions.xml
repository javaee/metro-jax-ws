    <section xml:id="sending-and-receiving-soap-headers">
        <title>Sending and Receiving SOAP Headers</title>

        <para>At times you need a way to send and receive SOAP headers in your
        message - these headers may not be defined in the WSDL binding but
        your application needs to do it anyway. One approach has been to write
        a <literal>SOAPHandler</literal> to do it, but its more work and is
        expensive as <literal>SOAPHandlers</literal> work on
        <literal>SOAPMesssage</literal> which is DOM based and JAX-WS runtime
        would need to do conversion from its abstract
        <literal>Message</literal> representation to
        <literal>SOAPMessage</literal> and vice versa.</para>

        <para>There is a way to do it on the client side by downcasting the
        proxy to <literal>WSBindingProvider</literal> and use methods on
        it.</para>

        <section xml:id="sending-soap-headers">
            <title>Sending SOAP Headers</title>

            <para>You would downcasting the proxy to
            <literal>WSBindingProvider</literal> and set the
            <literal>Outbound</literal> headers.</para>

            <informalexample>
                <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[HelloService helloService = new HelloService();
HelloPort port = helloService.getHelloPort();
WSBindingProvider bp = (WSBindingProvider) port;

bp.setOutboundHeaders(
        // simple string value as a header, like stringValue
        Headers.create(new QName("simpleHeader"), "stringValue"),
        // create a header from JAXB object
        Headers.create(jaxbContext, myJaxbObject));]]></programlisting>
            </informalexample>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="receiving-soap-headers">
            <title>Receiving SOAP Headers</title>

            <informalexample>
                <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[List<Header> inboundHeaders = bp.getInboundHeaders();]]></programlisting>
            </informalexample>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="message-logging">
        <title>Message logging</title>

        <para>Web Services developers generally need to see SOAP Messages that
        are transferred between client and service for debugging. There are
        SOAP Monitors for this job, but you need modify the client or server
        code to use those tools. &jax-ws.product.name.short; provides logging
        of SOAP messages</para>

        <section xml:id="on-the-client">
            <title>On the client</title>

            <para>Set system property</para>

            <informalexample>
                <programlisting><![CDATA[com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.client.HttpTransportPipe.dump=true]]></programlisting>
            </informalexample>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="on-the-server-side">
            <title>On the server side</title>

            <para>Set system property</para>

            <informalexample>
                <programlisting><![CDATA[com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.HttpAdapter.dump=true]]></programlisting>

    <section xml:id="propagation-of-server-side-stacktrace">
        <title>Propagation of Server-side Stacktrace</title>

        <para>This is a very useful feature while developing Web Services.
        Often the soap fault messages for not user defined faults does not
        convey enough information about the problem. &jax-ws.product.name.short;
        relieves you from digging out the server logs to find out the stacktrace.
        Whole stacktrace (including nested exceptions) can be propagated in the
        SOAP Fault and the complete exception stacktrace can be made visible to
        the client as cause of <literal>SOAPFaultException</literal>.</para>

        <section xml:id="enabling-propagation-of-server-side-stacktrace">
            <title>Enabling propagation of Server-side stacktrace</title>

            <para>Propagation of Stack trace is off by default. To turn it on
            for your Web Service Application to send the complete stack trace,
            set the system property</para>

            <informalexample>
                <programlisting><![CDATA[com.sun.xml.ws.fault.SOAPFaultBuilder.captureStackTrace=true]]></programlisting>
