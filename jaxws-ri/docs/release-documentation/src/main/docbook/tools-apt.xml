        <para>The <command>apt</command> tool provided a facility for
        programmatically processing the annotations added to Java by <link

        <emphasis>Metadata Facility for the Java</emphasis> TM
        <emphasis>Programming Language</emphasis>. In brief, JSR 175 allows
        programmers to declare new kinds of structured modifiers that can be
        associated with program elements, fields, methods, classes,
        etc.</para>
         
        <para>The <command>javac</command> completely replaced functionality
        provided by <command>apt</command>. It was done within implementation of <link
        xlink:href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=269">JSR 269</link>,
        <emphasis>Pluggable Annotation Processing API</emphasis>.
        So it's expected programmers to use <command>javac</command> instead of
        <command>apt</command>.</para>

        <para>Using <command>javac</command> with JAX-WS annotation processor
        will generate portable artifacts used in JAX-WS services.</para>

        <para>
            Be aware that the <command>apt</command> tool and its associated API,
            <command>com.sun.mirror.\*</command>, are being deprecated in JDK 7.
