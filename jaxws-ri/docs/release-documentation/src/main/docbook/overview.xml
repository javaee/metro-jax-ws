        <para>The documentation/samples included with JAX-WS that is
        distributed on Java.net describes how to use JAX-WS to develop and
        deploy your webservices endpoints in a servlet container. The samples
        discussed in this document and available as part of JAX-WS
        distribution are tested to work on Glassfish and on Apache Tomcat. The
        deployment is demonstrated using JAX-WS RI specific proprietary
        deployment descriptor sun-jaxws.xml. </para>

        <para>If you wish to use JAX-WS in a Java EE container in a portable
        manner (using JSR 109 deployment descriptors), please refer to the
        <link xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/index.jsp">Java EE
        6</link> or <link
        xlink:href="http://glassfish.java.net/">Glassfish</link>
        documentation/samples. The majority of the documentation included with
        JAX-WS is valid with Java EE 6 as well.</para>
