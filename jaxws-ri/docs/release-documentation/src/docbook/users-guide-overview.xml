        <para>This document describes the new features available in this
        release of the &jax-ws.product.name.short;. The main focus of this
        document is to describe the tools used to develop
        &jax-ws.product.name; web service endpoints and clients. Readers of
        this document should be familiar with web services <link

        Familiarity with <link

        may also be beneficial but is not necessary.</para>

        <para>The documentation/samples discusses how to use JAX-WS in a
        non-Java EE 5 servlet container using a proprietary deployment
        descriptor <literal>sun-jaxws.xml</literal> and servlet
        <literal>com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet</literal>.
        This means that you can run &jax-ws.product.name.short; applications
        in any servlet container that has been enabled with the
        &jax-ws.product.name.short;. Applications that use the proprietary DD
        and servlet will run in a &jax-ws.product.name.short; enabled Java EE
        5 servlet container, but they will be non-portable. If you wish to use
        JAX-WS in a Java EE container in a Java EE portable manner you need to
        use the standard Java EE 5 deployment descriptor; please refer to the
        <link xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/index.jsp">Java EE
        5</link> or <link
        xlink:href="http://glassfish.java.net/">Glassfish</link>
        documentation/samples. The majority of the documentation included with
        JAX-WS is valid with Java EE 5 as well.</para>

            <para>JAX-RPC users should note that JAX-WS is a completely
            different technology than JAX-RPC and thus cannot run JAX-RPC
            applications on top of JAX-WS. If you have an existing JAX-RPC
            application it must be converted to work with JAX-WS.</para>

        <section xml:id="fully-dynamic-runtime">
            <title>Fully Dynamic Runtime</title>

            <para>In JAX-WS, all artifacts generated by
            <command>apt</command>, <command>wsimport</command> and
            <command>wsgen</command> are portable. JAX-WS uses the annotations
            within the SEI to aid in marshalling/unmarshalling messages.
            Because we no longer generated non-portable artifacts, we were
            able to get rid of tools like JAX-RPC's
            <command>wsdeploy</command>. The user now can create their own
            deployable WAR file. To learn more about creating a WAR file and
            the deployment descriptor, see <xref
            linkend="users-guide-war-file-packaging"
            xrefstyle="select:title" />. It should also be noted that
            JAX-RPC's <command>wscompile</command> tool has been replaced by
            two new tools: <command>wsimport</command> and
            <command>wsgen</command>. <command>wsimport</command> is used for
            importing WSDLs and generating the portable artifacts.
            <command>wsgen</command> processes a compiled SEI and generates
            the portable artifacts. Unlike JAX-RPC's
            <command>wscompile</command> JAX-WS's <command>wsgen</command>
            does not generate WSDL at tool-time, the WSDL is now generated
            when the endpoint is deployed. There however is an option on
            <command>wsgen</command> to generate the WSDL for developement
            purposes.</para>

        <section xml:id="mtom-amp-swaref">
            <title>MTOM &amp; swaRef</title>

            <para>MTOM and swaRef support was added in JAX-WS 2.0 RI FCS
            release. MTOM and swaref support is required by the JAX-WS 2.0
            specification. This means that the MTOM or swaref solution
            developed with &jax-ws.product.name.short; will be fully portable
            with any JAX-WS 2.0 compliant implementation.</para>

            <para>MTOM implementation was completely re-written to allow
            streaming attachment support and just like rest of the
            &jax-ws.product.name.short; runtime its written for better
            performance. This implementation was released as part of JAX-WS
            2.0.1 M1 release.</para>

            <para>JAX-WS &jax-ws.release.spec.version; brings in support for

            <para>Support for XML/HTTP binding is added to JAX-WS 2.0. One can
            directly send XML over HTTP using <xref

            <para>&jax-ws.product.name; uses JAXB 2.2 for data-binding between

                annotation which can be used to tell JAXB to use the classes

                <para>JAX-WS 2.2 spec allows <literal>@XmlElement</literal> on
                web service SEI parameters, which enables better control of
                XML representation. For this support, JAX-WS relies on JAXB
                2.2 API which allows the <literal>@XmlElement</literal>
                annotation on parameters.</para>

            <para>JAX-WS 2.0 specification defines standard XML based
            customization for a WSDL file to Java mapping and to control
            certain features. These customizations, or <emphasis>binding
            declarations,</emphasis> can customize almost all WSDL components
            that can be mapped to Java, such as the service endpoint interface
            class, method name, parameter name, exception class, etc. The
            other important thing you can do with these binding declarations
            is to control certain features, such as asynchrony, provider,
            wrapper style, and additional headers. For example, a client
            application can enable asynchrony for a particular operation in a
            portType, all operations in a <literal>portType</literal>, or all
            <literal>portType</literal> operations defined in the WSDL
            file.</para>

            <para>These binding declarations can be inlined in a WSDL file or
            can live outside as an external file. The binding declarations
            closely align with the JAXB binding declarations. An application
            importing a WSDL file can inline JAXB bindings inside JAX-WS
            binding declarations to customize the inlined schema declared in
            the WSDL file. Schema files that are imported from a WSDL file can
            be customized using JAXB binding files and can be passed to
            <command>wscompile</command> using the <option>-b</option> option
            switch.</para>

            <para>JAX-WS 2.0 specification defines two types of handlers:
            logical and protocol handlers. While protocol handlers have access
            to an entire message such as a SOAP message, logical handlers deal
            only with the payload of a message and are independent of the
            protocol being used. Handler chains can now be configured on a
            per-port, per-protocol, or per-service basis. A new framework of
            context objects has been added to allow client code to share
            information easily with handlers.</para>

        <title>Programming Model</title>

        <para>This section of the documentation will focus on the programming
        model for both developing and publishing a web service endpoint, and
        writing a web service client. A web service endpoint is the
        implementation of a web service. A web service client is an
        application that accesses a web service.</para>

        <section xml:id="server">
            <title>Server</title>

            <para>When developing a web service endpoint, a developer may
            either start from a Java endpoint implementation class or from a
            WSDL file. A WSDL (Web Services Description Language) document
            describes the contract between the web service endpoint and the
            client. A WSDL document may include and/or import XML schema files
            used to describe the data types used by the web service. When
            starting from a Java class, the tools generate any portable
            artifacts as mandated by the spec. When starting from a WSDL file
            and schemas, the tools generate a service endpoint
            interface.</para>

            <para>There is a trade-off when starting from a Java class or from
            a WSDL file. If you start from a Java class, you can make sure
            that the endpoint implementation class has the desirable Java data
            types, but the developer has less control of the generated XML
            schema. When starting from a WSDL file and schema, the developer
            has total control over what XML schema is used, but has less
            control over what the generated service endpoint and the classes
            it uses will contain.</para>

                <para>In document/literal wrapped mode, two JavaBeans are

                Alternatively this service endpoint interface can be used to
                generate a WSDL and schema file. Please note that
                round-tripping is not guaranteed in this case. So the
                generated WSDL file and schema may not be the same as the one
