    <title>Stateful Webservice</title>

    <section xml:id="introduction-1">
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>&jax-ws.product.name.short; has a vendor extension that allows
        developers to bring back object state to the web service world.
        Normally, &jax-ws.product.name.short; only creates one instance of a
        service class, and have it serve all incoming requests concurrently.
        This makes it essentially impossible to use instance fields of the
        service class for any meaningful purpose.</para>

        <para>Because of this, people end up coding like C, in anti-OO
        fashion. Either that or you end up with writing boiler-plate code to
        dispatch a request to the right instance of your real domain
        object.</para>

        <para>The stateful web service support in &jax-ws.product.name.short;
        resolves this problem by having &jax-ws.product.name.short; maintain
        multiple instances of a service. By using <xref
        linkend="users-guide-ws-addressing" xrefstyle="select:title" /> behind
        the scene, it provides a standard-based on-the-wire protocol and
        easy-to-use programming model.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="usage">
        <title>Usage</title>

        <para>Application service implementation classes (or providers) who'd
        like to use the stateful web service support must declare
        <code>@Stateful</code> annotation on a class. It should also have a
        <emphasis role="bold">public static</emphasis> method/field that takes
        <code>StatefulWebServiceManager</code>.</para>

        <informalexample>
            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Stateful
@WebService
@Addressing
class BankAccount {
    
    protected final int id;
    private int balance;

    BankAccount(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @WebMethod
    public synchronized void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    // either via a public static field

    public static StatefulWebServiceManager<BankAccount> manager;

    // ... or  via a public static method (the method name could be 
    // anything)

    public static void setManager(StatefulWebServiceManager<BankAccount> 
                                          manager) {
        // ...
    }

}]]></programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>After your service is deployed but before you receive a first
        request, the resource injection occurs on the field or the
        method.</para>

        <para>A stateful web service class does not need to have a default
        constructor. In fact, most of the time you want to define a
        constructor that takes some arguments, so that each instance carries
        certain state (as illustrated in the above example).</para>

        <para>Each instance of a stateful web service class is identified by
        an unique <literal>EndpointReference</literal>. Your application
        creates an instance of a class, then you'll have
        &jax-ws.product.name.short; assign this unique EPR for the instance as
        follows:</para>

        <informalexample>
            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@WebService
class Bank { // this is ordinary stateless service

    @WebMethod
    public synchronized W3CEndpointReference login(int accountId, 
                                                   int pin) {
        if (!checkPin(pin))
            throw new AuthenticationFailedException("invalid pin");
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount(accountId);
        return BankAccount.manager.export(acc);
    }
    
}]]></programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Typically you then pass this EPR to remote systems. When they
        send messages to this EPR, &jax-ws.product.name.short; makes sure that
        the particular exported instance associated with that EPR will receive
        a service invocation.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="things-to-consider">
        <title>Things To Consider</title>

        <para>When you no longer need to tie an instance to the EPR, use
        <literal>unexport(Object)</literal> so that the object can be GC-ed
        (or else you'll leak memory). You may choose to do so explicitly, or
        you can rely on the time out by using <literal>setTimeout(long,
        Callback)</literal>.</para>

        <para><literal>StatefulWebServiceManager</literal> is thread-safe. It
        can be safely invoked from multiple threads concurrently.</para>
